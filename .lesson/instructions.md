# Instructions

Implement the binary search tree's `insert` and `has_data` methods, so that the data is inserted while maintaining the properties of a binary search tree, and `has_data` is capable of determining if a specific number is present in the tree.

This project is exactly the same as the previous Binary Search Tree project except you will need to use an underlying vector instead of Nodes with pointers.
